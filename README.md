# Spark-streaming
Bloom filtering, Flajolet Martin algorithm, and reservoir sampling algorithm

# **Introduction:**
In this repository, there is implementation of  three algorithms: 
* Bloom filtering.
* FlajoletMartin algorithm. 
* reservoir sampling. 


# **Programming Requirements:**
* You will need Spark Streaming library for task2- FlajoletMartin Algorithm. You will use Twitter streaming API
  streaming for task3: you can use the Python library, tweepy, and Scala library, sparkstreaming-twitter for this task.
* You can only use Spark RDD and standard Python or Scala libraries except for the ones in
  (b). i.e. no point if using Spark DataFrame or DataSet.

2.2 Programming Environment
Python 3.6, Scala 2.11 and Spark 2.3.2

# **Dataset:**
Yelp Business Data i.e., business_first.json and business_second.json
* For Bloom filtering you need to download the business_first.json and business_second.json from
* The first file is used to set up the bit array for Bloom fitering, and the second file is used for prediction.


# Tasks

## **Task1: Bloom Filtering:**
You will implement the Bloom Filtering algorithm to estimate whether the city of a business in
business_second.json has shown before in business_first.json. The details of the Bloom
Filtering Algorithm can be found at the streaming lecture slide. You need to find proper bit
array size, hash functions and the number of hash functions in the Bloom Filtering algorithm.
Some possible the hash functions are:
f(x)= (ax + b) % m or f(x) = ((ax + b) % p) % m
where p is any prime number and m is the length of the filter bit array. You can use any
combination for the parameters (a, b, p). The hash functions should keep the same once you
created them.
Since the city of a business is a string, you need to convert it into an integer and then apply
hash functions to it., the following code shows one possible solution:
import binascii
int(binascii.hexlify(s.encode('utf8')),16)
(We only treat the exact the same strings as the same cities. You do not need to consider
alias. If one record in the business_second.json file does not contain the city field, or the city
field is empty, you should directly predict zero for that record.)
